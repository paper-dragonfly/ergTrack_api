# ergTrack_api
backend for ergTrack App

## Motivation
I built ergTrack as a way to learn full stack development and because it is a product that I wanted to use and thought other might use too. I realized that many people, myself included, keep track of our erg workouts by taking photos of the memory screen and then proceeding to never do anything with those photos. I know most people are like me and are too lazy to manually enter data into the Concept2 LogBook so I wanted to create an image-to-text app that would convert memory screen photos into data in a database that could be easily referenced and compared

## Build Status
The backend is currently (10/14/22) working. It connects to a render hosted postgres database. The front end is curently not working well - see frontend readme for more info
