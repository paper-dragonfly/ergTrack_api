# ergTrack_api
backend for ergTrack App

## Description
ergTrack facilitates progress tracking for rowing athletes training on a Concept2 Ergometer (indoor rowing maching). This web app allows athletes to record workouts without the tedium of manual input by extracting, storing and organizing workout data from uploaded images of the ergometer memory screen.   

## Motivation
I built ergTrack as a way to learn full stack development and because it is a product that I wished existed. I realized many people, myself included, keep track of our erg workouts by taking photos of the memory screen and then proceeding to never do anything with those photos. Recognizing that people desire to track their progress but do not want to take the time to manually input workout data into storage system, I resolved to create an image-to-text app that would convert memory screen photos into data in a database that could be easily referenced and compared

## Build Status
(10/14/22) The backend is currently working. It connects to a render hosted postgres database.
